<h1>PIAIC</h1>
<h3 class="into_head">Presidental initiative for Artifical Intelligence And Computing</h3>
<p class="intro">
The mission of PIAIC is to reshape Pakistan by revolutionizing education, research, and business by adopting latest, cutting-edge technologies. Experts are calling this the 4th industrial revolution. We want Pakistan to become a global hub for AI, data science, cloud native computing, edge computing, blockchain, augmented reality, and internet of things.

<h3 class="into_head">Cloud Native Computing</h3>
<p class="intro">
Cloud native computing uses open-source software stacks to deploy applications as microservices, packaging each part into its own container and dynamically orchestrating those containers to optimize resource utilization. In the last 15 years, <span class="shadow">cloud application delivery has moved from being bound to physical servers to running on virtual machines with a full operating system and now to containers with Docker, where developers can specify every aspect of deployment.</span>

<h3 class="into_head">Artifical Intelligence</h3>
<p class="intro">
You won't find a top programmer, web developer, or AI engineer who doesn't use version control. This is true because version control helps developers produce better results and makes collaboration easy. Around the world, in teams both large and small, Git is an essential part of the toolchain. This module covers Git and Github.
In the second module of the program, students will learn about basic programming concepts such as lists, dictionaries, classes, functions and loops, and practice writing clean and readable code with exercises for each topic. Students will also learn how to make programs interactive and how to test code safely before adding it to a project. It is a fast-paced, thorough introduction to programming with Python 3.6 that will have students writing programs, solving problems, and making things that work in no time.
